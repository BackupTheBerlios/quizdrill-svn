About
=====
Quizdrill is a program to test mostly memorizing tasks to excess. It was inspired by langdrill[1], a language drill program, which itself was inspired by JavaDrill[2]. No code came from either, however the quizzes en-fr.drill, en-ja.drill, en-ja_romaji.drill and en-sv.drill are taken directly from langdrill (french.drill, japanese.drill, romaji.drill and swedish.drill).

Usage
=====
Start the program quizdrill.py. The different quizzes can be found in the quizzes folder. There is no need to install (e.g. make install etc.) and currently it is not supported either.

Help needed
===========
Quizdrill is a new Project and could use a lot of help. The easiest way and very appreciated is to send in your quizzes or extend the ones included. feature requests, bug reports and patches are very welcomed at the project page at berlios: http://developer.berlios.de/projects/quizdrill

Questions and feedback can be sent to the mailing list[3].

Adding new Quizzes
==================
The syntax of quizzes is very simple. A short look at one of them in the quizzes folder and you should know everything you need.

Lines starting with a "!" are meta-data giving information of the quiz itself. Lines containing only white-spaces or start with a "#" are ignored. Lines starting with a "[" start a new section and should end with a "]" (excluding white-spaces). It is strongly recommended that section-title is given in both languages, each separated by a "=". The actual vocabulary/quiz are a simple pair per line, separated by a "=".

Converting quiz files from langdrill
------------------------------------
langdrill drill files are by design very similar to quizdrill's. The only difference are the header lines. To convert a langdrill drill file, replace the [Application]-section with

!type: vocabulary
!language: <value of "directSenseName">=<value of "reverseSenseName">

and that is it. Note however, that quizdrill has a style-guideline for the quizfiles, which you might want to follow. However this can be done quickly and is not mandatory to be included to the quizdrill quizzes. So just send then to us rather than waiting into you are in the mood to fix it yourself ;-).

Project Goal
============
To offer an easy and efficient way for "learning-by-testing", this includes  creating programs to do the testing (tracking the results and selecting the next question), the different tests from many different topics (vocabulary, spelling, geography, math, ...)Â and documentation.
