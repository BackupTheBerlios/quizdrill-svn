Future Plans
============

Program
-------
* Testing
    * support for 1-directional-tests
        * math, geography, ...
        * image-tests
            * geography
        * sound-tests
            * dictating (spelling)
    * additional learning support
        * (better) selection of next quiz for the learning strategy
            * start with the SuperMemo v2[1] algorithm
              PROBLEM: how to score the answer (0-5), without making the
                user do this manually, which slows the testing down 
                considerably. Using the time needed to answer does not help as
                the user will get interrupted by other work, phone, ...
              IDEA: 0: wrong in multiple choice (mc); 1: right in mc
                2: right in simple quiz (sq) after peaking in mc
                3: wrong in sq with more than 1 try; 4: wrong in sq with 1 try
                5: right at first try (doesn't seem to be that accurate)
        * support learning strategies: e.g. Mnemonic[2] 
        * word said after correct answer on vocabulary tests
    * Test multiple quizzes
        * switch them between relax-times (not snoozing) as switching topics
          is unnecessarily difficult
* improve UI
    * support system-tray (notify when breaks over)
    * accessibility support
    * switch treeview colons, when test direction changes
    * easy edit of quizfile (open-in-editor or edit directly + save)
    * logo/icon
    * show question to wrong multi choice answer 
        (requires change of data structure)
* gconf-support
    * last/recent quiz
    * config-options
        * which ones ? => design Preferences-window
* fix Bugs ;-)
* translate in more languages

Documentation
-------------
* needed ...

Quiz
----
* more, more, more, ... ;-)
