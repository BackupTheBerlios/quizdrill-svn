Description: learning-by-testing to excess program
 A learning-by-testing program to learn quickly, mostly memorizing 
 tasks like vocabulary. Quizdrill supports multiple choice, simple
 quiz as well as flashcard testing. Although still quite immature
 Quizdrill asks questions according to how well they have been 
 previously answered to improve learning efficiency. Quizzes can are 
 created by editing simple text files or automatically built from
 Infobox-style templates of Wikipedia dumps (or other MediaWikis and 
 even Semantic MediaWikis).
