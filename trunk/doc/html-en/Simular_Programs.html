<p>Quizdrill was inspired by <a href='http://storm.prohosting.com/borco/programming/langdrill.html' class='external' title="http://storm.prohosting.com/borco/programming/langdrill.html">langdrill</a>, a language drill program, which itself was inspired by <a href='http://www.righto.com/java/fonts/learn.html' class='external' title="http://www.righto.com/java/fonts/learn.html">JavaDrill</a>. No code came from either, however the quizzes eng-fra.drill, eng-jpn.drill, eng-jpn_romaji.drill and eng-svd.drill are taken directly from langdrill (french.drill, japanese.drill, romaji.drill and swedish.drill). An other program which offers multible choice asking is <a href='http://akfquiz.akfoerster.de/' class='external' title="http://akfquiz.akfoerster.de/">AKFQuiz</a>. As opposed to any of these, quizdrill should ask the questions depending on previous answers to make learning as efficient as possible. Note however, that a lot of work still needs to be done.
<p>
Programs which also offer efficient learning include <a href='http://granule.sourceforge.net' class='external' title="http://granule.sourceforge.net">granule</a>, <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/pauker/' class='external' title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pauker/">Pauker</a> or <a href='http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/' class='external' title="http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/">mnemosyne</a>. At the moment these have more agressive learning strategies at the cost of only offering flash cards (as oposed to multible choice, simple quiz and flash cards) and being more in the way of the user (e.&nbsp;g. by asking the user <a href='http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/principles.php' class='external' title="http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/principles.php">to score how well he remembered it</a>).
