About
=====
Quizdrill is a program to test mostly memorizing tasks to excess. It was 
inspired by langdrill_, a language drill program, which itself was inspired 
by JavaDrill_. No code came from either, however the quizzes eng-fra.drill, 
eng-jpn.drill, eng-jpn_romaji.drill and eng-svd.drill are taken directly from 
langdrill (french.drill, japanese.drill, romaji.drill and swedish.drill). 
Quizdrill offers multiple choice test as well as simple test (where you type 
the answer). As opposed to langdrill quizdrill should ask the questions 
depending on previous answers to make learning as efficient as possible. Note 
however, that a lot of work still needs to be done.

Usage
-----
Quizdrill is designed to really drill you while you are working on the 
computer. After you answered some questions, it will minimize (iconify) and 
wait until your break is over (15min). You can however minimize it at any time 
and continue later. It will however unminimize to remind you (after 5min).

The different quizzes can be found in the quizzes folder. Just load one of
theme and test it.

Help needed
===========
Quizdrill is a new Project and could use a lot of help. The easiest way and 
very appreciated is to send in your quizzes or extend the ones included. 
Feature requests, bug reports and patches are very welcomed at the 
`project page at berlios`_. Questions and feedback can be sent to the 
`mailing list`_.

Adding new Quizzes
==================
The syntax of quizzes is very simple. A short look at one of them in the 
quizzes folder and you should know everything you need.

Lines starting with a "!" are meta-data giving information of the quiz itself. 
Lines containing only white-spaces or start with a "#" are ignored. Lines 
starting with a "[" start a new section and should end with a "]" (excluding 
white-spaces). It is strongly recommended that section-title is given in both 
languages, each separated by a "=". The actual vocabulary/quiz are a simple 
pair per line, separated by a "=".

Project Goal
============
To offer an easy and efficient way for "learning-by-testing", this includes  
creating programs to do the testing (tracking the results and selecting the 
next question), the different tests from many different topics (vocabulary, 
spelling, geography, math, ...) and documentation.
